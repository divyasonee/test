1)	Most important feature of java?
Java has the following features.
•	Security
•	Platform independent
•	Portable
•	Distributed 
•	Multiple threading
•	Exceptional handling
       The most important features are java is platform independent and open source.
2)	Platform independent?
Platform independent means, java can be used in any operating system.  Unlike ‘c’ which is platform dependent. Platform independent is operating system independent.
        This is because during compilation java converts the code into class, which is accepted by any native code of an operating system. 
3)	JVM,JDK,JRE:
Jvm-  java virtual machine which converts the class into a native code.
Jdk- java development kit- which is a development platform.
JRE- java runtime environment.
4)	Pointers?
Pointers is c  is used to call another variable by name or address. By doing this the data stored in that variable can be obtained. 
Since java is highly secured, pointers concept is absent in java.
5)	Base class?
An object is a base class in java.
6)	Local variables?
Local variables are temporary variables. Since they are temporary they are stored in stack memory. It cannot be initialized by default. 
      ‘this()’ and super() cannot be used.
7)	Class variables?
Class variables are also known as static  variables.
It is a single copy or source common for the other objects.
Any changes made in other objects is reflected in the class variable.
To access class variable, 
       Classname.variable name
8)	Public static void main???
Public refers to the accessibility of any user. 
Static- class name can be used as object.
Void main- does not return any value.
String args []-  for command line input
9)	Main method overloading
Yes the main method can be overloaded.
10)	Can a class declared protected?
Yes, a class can be declared protected by giving ‘private’ to the class.
19) if statements types?
        If else
        Nested if
        If else ladder
PART 2
1)	To display greatest number among 3 num
Class num{
public static void main (String args [])
{
Int a,b,c;
System.out.println(“enter three numbers”);
Scanner s= new scanner (system.in);
a = s.nextInt();
b = s.nextInt();
c = s.nextInt();
if (a > b  &&  a > c)
System.out.println(“ a is greatest”);
else
If ( b > a  &&  b > c)
System.out.println(“ b is greatest”);
else
If  (c > a   &&   c > b)
System.out.println(“ c is greatest”);
}
}
2)	Student grade 
public class grade
{
public static void main(String args[ ])
{
int marks=50;
string =result;
{
if (marks==20)
System.out.println("result="grade U");
if (marks==30)
System.out.println("result="grade C);
if (marks==40)
System.out.println("result="grade B);
if (marks==50)
System.out,println("result="grade A);
}
}
}
